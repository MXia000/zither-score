# Welcome to the Num Score app!

This website application is almost exactly like [FlatIO](https://flat.io), _including_ the appearance! It allows users to create score sheets in the cipher / jianpu / numbered musical notation.

Please be advised that there are certainly main missing features in creating music scores, such as symbols that currently might not be available. It _is_ a work in progress! 

**Check our [wiki](https://github.com/leahmezacs/zither-score/wiki) for more detailed information!**

#### Note to developers:
For those using npm... install react-scripts: `npm i react-scripts`

The Num Score will be host at http://localhost:3000/
